---

3.5 Monitoring & Evaluation

Metrics:

Performance KPIs: Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown.

Execution KPIs: Order latency, slippage.

Real-Time Alerts: Slack/Email notifications for critical events.


Tools:

Prometheus/Grafana: Dashboards for live monitoring.

ELK Stack: Log aggregation and error detection.


# Example: Prometheus metrics for performance
from prometheus_client import Gauge, start_http_server
sharpe_ratio = Gauge("sharpe_ratio", "Sharpe Ratio of the portfolio")
sharpe_ratio.set(1.25)
start_http_server(8000)

4. Advanced Trading Strategies

1. Mean Reversion

Uses Bollinger Bands and RSI to detect price extremes.

Example: Long positions when price crosses below the lower band.


2. Trend Following

Combines moving averages and MACD for trend confirmation.


3. Arbitrage

Monitors real-time spreads across exchanges for triangular or cross-exchange arbitrage.


4. Options Trading

Implements delta-neutral strategies like iron condors for volatility events.
